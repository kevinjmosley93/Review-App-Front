# Review App Front

## Application

This is final project for General Assembly, a review app named `Review-Me-App`. This application was broken into two parts: `Review-App-Front` & `Review-App-Back`. The `Review-App-Front` was designed to communitcate with `Review-App-Back` API, so that a user can go through the process of reviewing a product.

## Important Links

## Planning Story

I started by creating the ERD and Wireframes for the project. I then created the **_Backend_** of the application before moving to the **_Frontend_** to confirm my API routes were working. Lastly, I deployed both parts of the application and added styling.
